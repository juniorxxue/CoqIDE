*An alternative splash screen for GNU Emacs*

[[./splash.png]]

*Features*

- No logo (not even in graphical mode)
- Vertical and horizontal scroll bars are hidden
- Modeline is hidden
- =<space>=, =x=, =q=, =<esc>=, =<return>= or =<mouse-1>= kills the splash screen
- =C-h= shows the regular startup screen (=about-emacs=)
- Splash screen is automatically killed after 3 seconds
- With emacs-mac (Mituharu), splash screen is faded out after 3 seconds

*Usage*

#+begin_src lisp
(require 'splash-screen)
#+end_src

*Note* The splash screen is not shown if there are opened file buffers. For
     example, if you start emacs with a filename on the command  line,
     the splash is not shown.
